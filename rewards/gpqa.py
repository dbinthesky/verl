    s = "[think]\nOkay, so I need to find the symmedian point of triangle ABC with vertices at A(0,0), B(10,0), and C(3,5). Hmm, symmedian point... I remember that the symmedian point is the point where the three symmedians of the triangle intersect. A symmedian is the reflection of a median over the corresponding angle bisector. But maybe there's a more formulaic way to approach this instead of constructing each symmedian?\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of the symmedian point. I think it's also known as the Lemoine point. One important thing is that it can be found as the weighted average of the vertices using the squares of the lengths of the sides. The coordinates of the symmedian point are given by the formula:\n\n\\( K \\left( \\frac{a^2 x_A + b^2 x_B + c^2 x_C}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}, \\frac{a^2 y_A + b^2 y_B + c^2 y_C}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} \\right) \\)\n\nWait, is that right? Or is it divided by the sum of the squares? Let me check. The formula for the symmedian point (Lemoine point) uses the side lengths squared. Let me confirm that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is using the cotangents or something else? Hmm. Maybe I should try to verify this formula. Let me think. \n\nAnother approach is to compute the symmedian lines for each vertex and find their intersection. Since a symmedian is the reflection of the median over the angle bisector. Alternatively, there's a formula in barycentric coordinates. The symmedian point has trilinear coordinates proportional to \\( a^2 : b^2 : c^2 \\), so in barycentric coordinates, it's \\( (a^2, b^2, c^2) \\), but normalized by dividing by \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\). \n\nWait, so perhaps the coordinates in barycentric would be \\( \\frac{a^2}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} \\), etc., which translates to Cartesian coordinates as \\( \\frac{a^2 A + b^2 B + c^2 C}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} \\), where A, B, C are the vertices. \n\nTherefore, if I compute the lengths of the sides opposite to each vertex, which are a, b, c. Wait, in barycentric coordinates, usually, a is BC, b is AC, and c is AB. So let me make sure I get the side lengths correctly.\n\nFirst, let me compute the lengths of the sides:\n\nGiven points A(0,0), B(10,0), C(3,5). \n\nLet's compute the lengths:\n\nSide a: length opposite vertex A, which is BC.\n\nCoordinates of B(10,0) and C(3,5). \n\nDistance BC: sqrt[(10-3)^2 + (0-5)^2] = sqrt[49 + 25] = sqrt[74]\n\nSimilarly, side b: opposite vertex B, which is AC. \n\nCoordinates A(0,0) and C(3,5). \n\nDistance AC: sqrt[(3)^2 + (5)^2] = sqrt[9+25]=sqrt[34]\n\nSide c: opposite vertex C, which is AB.\n\nCoordinates A(0,0) and B(10,0). \n\nDistance AB: sqrt[(10)^2 + 0] = 10.\n\nTherefore, sides are: a = BC = sqrt(74), b = AC = sqrt(34), c = AB = 10.\n\nTherefore, the barycentric coordinates of the symmedian point are proportional to \\( a^2 : b^2 : c^2 \\).\n\nThus, the weights are:\n\na² = 74, b² = 34, c² = 100.\n\nSum = 74 + 34 + 100 = 208.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates in barycentric would be (74/208, 34/208, 100/208). But in Cartesian coordinates, this would translate to:\n\nx = (74 * x_A + 34 * x_B + 100 * x_C) / 208,\n\nSimilarly for y-coordinate.\n\nWait, but hold on. In barycentric coordinates, the coordinates are weighted by the weights (a², b², c²), so the symmedian point is:\n\n\\( \\left( \\frac{a^2 x_A + b^2 x_B + c^2 x_C}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}, \\frac{a^2 y_A + b^2 y_B + c^2 y_C}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} \\right) \\)\n\nWait, actually, in barycentric coordinates, the coordinates are mass points where the masses are the weights. But in Cartesian coordinates, the formula would be:\n\n\\( \\frac{a^2 \\vec{A} + b^2 \\vec{B} + c^2 \\vec{C}}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} \\).\n\nTherefore, yes, that formula seems correct.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\nFirst, let's compute each component:\n\nFor the x-coordinate:\n\n74*(0) + 34*(10) + 100*(3). Wait, hold on. Wait, in barycentric coordinates, the weights correspond to the vertex opposite the side.\n\nWait, hold on, actually I might have made a mistake here. Let's think carefully.\n\nWait, in barycentric coordinates, the symmedian point has trilinear coordinates proportional to \\( \\frac{1}{a^2} : \\frac{1}{b^2} : \\frac{1}{c^2} \\), but wait, no, maybe the other way.\n\nWait, actually trilinear coordinates for the symmedian point are proportional to \\( a : b : c \\), but in barycentric coordinates, it's \\( a^2 : b^2 : c^2 \\). Let me confirm this.\n\nAccording to the references, the symmedian point has trilinear coordinates \\( \\sec (A/2) : \\sec (B/2) : \\sec (C/2) \\), but that's different. Wait, maybe I confused with the Gergonne or something else. Hmm.\n\nWait, according to Weisstein's World of Mathematics:\n\n\"The symmedian point is the point of concurrency of the symmedians of a triangle. It is also equivalent to the isogonal conjugate of the centroid. The symmedian point has trilinear coordinates a : b : c, and the centroid is 1:1:1.\"\n\nWait a second, hold on. Wait, trilinear coordinates as a : b : c?\n\nWait, but if that's the case, then in barycentric coordinates, since trilinear coordinates are proportional to a, b, c, then barycentric coordinates would be proportional to \\( a \\times (a, b, c) \\), or not?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to recall:\n\nTrilinear coordinates are proportional to the distances to the sides, whereas barycentric coordinates are proportional to masses at the vertices.\n\nThere is a relationship between trilinear and barycentric coordinates. The barycentric coordinates can be obtained from trilinear coordinates by multiplying by side lengths.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the barycentric coordinates.\n\nLet me check another source. Alternatively, perhaps another approach. Since I might be confused here, let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for symmedian point coordinates in Cartesian coordinates is:\n\n\\( K = \\left( \\frac{a^2 x_A + b^2 x_B + c^2 x_C}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}, \\frac{a^2 y_A + b^2 y_B + c^2 y_C}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} \\right) \\)\n\nwhere a, b, c are lengths of sides opposite to A, B, C respectively. Wait, that must be it. Let me verify this formula.\n\nSuppose in triangle ABC, the symmedian point can indeed be given by that formula.\n\nLet me check with an equilateral triangle. Suppose triangle with vertices at (0,0), (1,0), (0.5, sqrt(3)/2). The side lengths would all be 1. Then, the symmedian point would be at centroid? Wait no, the centroid is ( (0+1+0.5)/3, etc.), which is (0.5, sqrt(3)/6). But symmedian point in an equilateral triangle should coincide with centroid, incenter, circumcenter, etc., so that would be consistent. Using the formula: a = b = c = 1, so coordinates would be (1*0 +1*1 +1*0.5)/3, (1*0 +1*0 +1*(sqrt(3)/2))/3) = ( (1.5)/3, (sqrt(3)/2)/3 ) = (0.5, sqrt(3)/6 ), same as centroid. So that seems okay. Therefore, the formula is probably correct.\n\nSo then, applying this formula for the given triangle.\n\nGiven that:\n\na = length of BC = sqrt(74)\n\nb = length of AC = sqrt(34)\n\nc = length of AB = 10\n\nTherefore, a² = 74, b² = 34, c² = 100\n\nCoordinates of A(0,0), B(10,0), C(3,5)\n\nSo plug into x-coordinate:\n\n(74*(0) + 34*(10) + 100*(3)) / (74+34+100) \n\nWait, hold on! Wait, wait a second. Wait, in the formula, is it a² multiplied by x_A? Wait, but in the formula, a is the length opposite A, so the formula is:\n\nSymmedian point K is ( (a² x_A + b² x_B + c² x_C)/(a² + b² + c²), similarly for y )\n\nWait, but here, since a is the side opposite to A (which is BC), so yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, yes, plugging in:\n\nNumerator for x-coordinate: a² x_A = 74 * 0 = 0,\n\nb² x_B = 34 * 10,\n\nc² x_C = 100 * 3,\n\nso total numerator for x: 34*10 + 100*3 = 340 + 300 = 640\n\nDenominator: 74 + 34 + 100 = 208\n\nTherefore x-coordinate is 640 / 208.\n\nSimplify: 640 divided by 208.\n\nLet's divide numerator and denominator by 16: 640 /16=40, 208 /16=13. So 40/13 ≈ 3.0769...\n\nSimilarly, y-coordinate:\n\nNumerator: a² y_A + b² y_B + c² y_C.\n\nSo:\n\na² y_A = 74*0 = 0,\n\nb² y_B = 34*0 = 0,\n\nc² y_C = 100*5 = 500,\n\nThus numerator y: 500,\n\nDivide by 208, so y-coordinate = 500 / 208.\n\nSimplify: divide numerator and denominator by 4: 125 / 52 ≈ 2.4038...\n\nSo coordinates would be (40/13, 125/52). Let me check if that can be simplified further. 40 and 13 are coprime, 125 and 52 are coprime. 52 factors into 4*13, so maybe 125/52 is simplest.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I did the calculations correctly. Let me recompute:\n\nFirst, a² is BC squared, which is (10-3)^2 + (0-5)^2 = 49 + 25 = 74, correct.\n\nb² is AC squared, which is (3)^2 + (5)^2 = 9 +25 = 34, correct.\n\nc squared is AB squared, which is (10)^2 = 100, correct.\n\nx numerator: a² x_A is 74*0 = 0, b² x_B is 34*10=340, c² x_C is 100*3=300. So total x numerator is 340+300=640. Correct.\n\nDenominator 74+34+100=208. So 640/208. 640 divided by 208:\n\n208*3=624, so 640-624=16, so 3 + 16/208 = 3 + 4/52= 3 + 1/13. Hmm, but as an improper fraction, it's 640/208.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by GCD(640,208). Let's see factors:\n\n208 divides by 16: 208 =16*13, 640 is 16*40, so GCD is 16, so 640/208 = 40/13. Yes, correct.\n\nSimilarly y-coordinate numerator: 100*5=500. 500 divided by 208. GCD(500,208). 208 divides by 8: 208=8*26. 500=8*62.5, so not integer. Let's try GCD(500,208). Let's do prime factors:\n\n208: 2^4 *13\n\n500: 2^2 *5^3\n\nSo common factors 2^2, so 4. Therefore 500/208 = (500/4)/(208/4)=125/52. 125 and 52 have no common factors (52 is 4*13, 125 is 5^3). Correct.\n\nTherefore, coordinates are (40/13, 125/52). \n\nBut to make sure, maybe I should verify this another way, using another method like finding the symmedian lines and their intersection.\n\nLet's see. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, I need to find the symmedian from vertex A. The symmedian is the reflection of the median over the angle bisector. Alternatively, the symmedian can be defined as the locus of points whose cevian divides the sides in the ratio of the squares of the adjacent sides.\n\nAlternatively, in coordinates, maybe we can compute the equation of the symmedian from A, then the same for another vertex and find the intersection.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, let's compute the symmedian from vertex A(0,0).\n\nFirst, let's find the median from A to BC. The midpoint M of BC is:\n\nCoordinates of B(10,0) and C(3,5). So midpoint M:\n\nx: (10 + 3)/2 = 13/2 = 6.5, y: (0 +5)/2 =2.5. So M is (6.5, 2.5).\n\nSo the median from A is the line from A(0,0) to M(6.5, 2.5). The equation of this median can be parametrized as:\n\nx = 6.5 t, y= 2.5 t, where t ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nNow, to find the symmedian, which is the reflection of this median over the angle bisector at A. Hmm, this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the symmedian direction.\n\nAnother method: the symmedian is the reflection of the median over the angle bisector, but the angle bisector can be computed, so maybe compute the angle bisector direction, then compute reflection.\n\nAlternatively, since the symmedian direction can be found via the ratio of the sides squared. The direction vector of the symmedian from A is proportional to (b² - c²) direction? Wait, perhaps I should recall that in triangle ABC, the symmedian from A divides the opposite side in the ratio of the squares of the adjacent sides: AB² / AC².\n\nWait, yes, the ratio in which the symmedian divides the opposite side is proportional to the squares of the adjacent sides.\n\nSo the symmedian from A will divide side BC into segments proportional to AB² / AC².\n\nWait, so the symmedian line from A meets BC at a point, say, D, such that BD/DC = AB² / AC².\n\nGiven that AB is 10, AC is sqrt(34), so AB² is 100, AC² is 34. Therefore BD/DC = 100/34 ≈ 2.941...\n\nTherefore, coordinates of D can be found using section formula.\n\nCoordinates of B(10,0), C(3,5). So point D divides BC in the ratio BD:DC = 100 :34. That is, BD = (100/(100+34)) * BC vector?\n\nWait, more precisely, if BD/DC = 100/34, then coordinates of D are:\n\nx = (100*3 + 34*10)/(100 + 34),\n\ny = (100*5 +34*0)/(100 +34).\n\nWait, section formula: if BD:DC = m:n, then D's coordinates are ( (n*Bx + m*Cx)/(m +n), (n*By + m*Cy)/(m +n) )\n\nHere m is BD, n is DC, so the ratio is m:n = 100:34. Therefore:\n\nx = (34*10 +100*3)/(100+34),\n\ny = (34*0 +100*5)/134.\n\nCompute:\n\nx = (340 + 300)/134 = 640/134,\n\nWait, 34*10 = 340, 100*3 =300. 340+300=640. Therefore, x= 640/134 = 320/67 ≈4.776...\n\ny = (0 + 500)/134 =500/134 =250/67 ≈3.731...\n\nTherefore, the symmedian from A goes through A(0,0) and D(640/134, 500/134). So the direction vector is (640/134,500/134). Let's write the equation of the symmedian line from A.\n\nParametric equations: x = (640/134)t, y= (500/134)t. But to get an equation in standard form, perhaps we can compute the slope.\n\nSlope is (500/134)/(640/134) = 500/640 = 25/32. Therefore, the equation is y = (25/32)x.\n\nSo symmedian from A: y = (25/32)x.\n\nNow, let's compute another symmedian, say from vertex B.\n\nFollowing the same method. The symmedian from B to side AC.\n\nFirst, the median from B to AC's midpoint. Let's find the midpoint N of AC:\n\nCoordinates A(0,0) and C(3,5). Midpoint N:\n\nx=(0+3)/2=1.5, y=(0+5)/2=2.5. So N is (1.5,2.5). The median from B(10,0) to N(1.5,2.5). The direction of this median is from (10,0) to (1.5,2.5). The vector is (-8.5, 2.5).\n\nBut again, instead of dealing with reflection over angle bisector, perhaps better to use the ratio method.\n\nThe symmedian from B divides side AC into segments proportional to BA² / BC². Wait, sides adjacent to B are BA and BC, so the ratio is BA² / BC² ?\n\nWait, let me confirm.\n\nThe symmedian from vertex B divides the opposite side AC into segments proportional to (BA)^2 / (BC)^2.\n\nWait, formula: the symmedian from B divides AC into lengths proportional to BA² / BC².\n\nThus, if point E is where the symmedian from B meets AC, then AE/EC = (BA)^2/(BC)^2.\n\nWait, actually, is it (BA)^2 / (BC)^2 or (BA)^2/(BC)^2?\n\nWait, actually, the ratio is (AB)^2/(BC)^2. Wait, perhaps more precisely, the ratio is AB² / BC² if it's the symmedian from B?\n\nWait, let me think again. For the symmedian from B, the line will divide the opposite side AC into a ratio proportional to the squares of the adjacent sides.\n\nThe sides adjacent to vertex B are BA and BC. So BA is length c = 10, and BC is length a = sqrt(74). Wait, or BC is opposite A, but adjacent to B?\n\nYes, adjacent sides to angle B are BA and BC. So BA is AB = c =10, and BC is a =sqrt(74).\n\nWait, in terms of the formula for the symmedian dividing the opposite side AC, the ratio is AB² / BC² ?\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, in the formula, the ratio AE/EC = AB² / BC². Let me confirm with a reference.\n\nYes, according to some sources, the symmedian from B divides AC into segments proportional to AB² : BC². \n\nTherefore, AE/EC = (AB)^2/(BC)^2 = (10)^2/(sqrt(74))² = 100/74 =50/37.\n\nThus, the point E divides AC in the ratio AE:EC =50:37.\n\nCoordinates of A(0,0), C(3,5). Then point E:\n\nx_E = (37*0 +50*3)/(50+37) = 150/87,\n\ny_E = (37*0 +50*5)/87 =250/87.\n\nSimplify: 150/87 =50/29 ≈1.724, and 250/87≈2.873.\n\nTherefore, the symmedian from B passes through point E(50/29,250/87) and vertex B(10,0). So we can write its equation.\n\nFirst, find the direction vector from B to E:\n\nCoordinates from B(10,0) to E(50/29,250/87):\n\nΔx = 50/29 -10 =50/29 -290/29= -240/29,\n\nΔy =250/87 -0 =250/87.\n\nThus, direction vector is (-240/29,250/87). To make this simpler, we can multiply numerator and denominator to eliminate fractions:\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the slope:\n\nSlope m = Δy / Δx = (250/87)/(-240/29) = (250/87)*( -29/240 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n250/240 =25/24,\n\n29/87 =1/3,\n\nThus, m = (25/24)*( -1/3 )= -25/(72)\n\nTherefore, the equation of the symmedian from B is:\n\nUsing point B(10,0):\n\ny -0 = m(x -10)\n\nSo, y = (-25/72)(x -10)\n\nSo that's the equation: y = (-25/72)x + (250)/72\n\nNow, to find the intersection of symmedian from A (y =25/32 x) and symmedian from B (y= -25/72 x +250/72 )\n\nSet equal:\n\n25/32 x = -25/72 x +250/72\n\nMultiply both sides by 32*72 to eliminate denominators:\n\n25*72 x = -25*32 x + 250*32\n\nCompute each term:\n\n25*72 =1800, so 1800x,\n\n-25*32 = -800x,\n\n250*32 =8000\n\nThus,\n\n1800x +800x =8000\n\n2600x =8000,\n\nx=8000 /2600 =80/26=40/13≈3.0769...\n\nNow, substitute back to find y:\n\ny=25/32*(40/13)= (25*40)/(32*13)= (1000)/(416)= divide numerator and denominator by 8: 125/52≈2.4038...\n\nThus, the coordinates are (40/13, 125/52), which matches the first method! Good, that's reassuring.\n\nNow, just to confirm, let's compute the third symmedian, maybe from C, and see if it also passes through that point.\n\nSo let's compute the symmedian from point C(3,5).\n\nFirst, the median from C to the midpoint of AB. Midpoint of AB is O( (0+10)/2, (0+0)/2 )=(5,0). So the median is from C(3,5) to O(5,0). The direction vector is (5-3, 0-5) = (2,-5). The slope is -5/2.\n\nBut again, the symmedian from C would be found via the ratio on side AB.\n\nThe symmedian from C will divide AB into a ratio proportional to CA² / CB².\n\nThe adjacent sides to C are CB (length a =sqrt74) and CA (length b= sqrt34). Wait, adjacent to angle C are sides CB and CA, so the ratio is CA²/CB² =34/74 =17/37.\n\nThus, the point F on AB where the symmedian meets AB divides AB such that AF / FB = CA² / CB² =34/74 =17/37.\n\nCoordinates of A(0,0), B(10,0). So the point F divides AB into AF:FB =17:37.\n\nCoordinates of F:\n\nx = (37*0 +17*10)/(17+37)=170/54=85/27≈3.148,\n\ny= (37*0 +17*0)/54=0.\n\nThus F is (85/27,0).\n\nTherefore, the symmedian from C passes through points C(3,5) and F(85/27,0). Let's find its equation.\n\nFirst, compute the direction vector from C to F:\n\nΔx =85/27 -3 =85/27 -81/27=4/27,\n\nΔy=0 -5= -5.\n\nSo slope m = (-5)/(4/27) = -5*(27/4)= -135/4.\n\nThus, the equation of the symmedian from C is:\n\ny -5 = (-135/4)(x -3)\n\nLet's see if (40/13,125/52) satisfies this equation.\n\nPlug x=40/13 into the right side:\n\nFirst compute x-3: 40/13 - 3 = 40/13 -39/13=1/13,\n\nMultiply by -135/4: (-135/4)*(1/13)= -135/(52),\n\nThus, the right side is -135/52 +5 = (-135/52 + 260/52 ) = (125)/52,\n\nLeft side is y -5 = 125/52 -5 = (125/52 -260/52)= -135/52,\n\nWait, wait, let me re-express:\n\nWait the equation is:\n\ny = [ -135/4 (x -3) ] +5\n\nSo substituting x =40/13,\n\ny = -135/4*(40/13 -39/13) +5\n\nWait, 40/13 -3 is 40/13 - 39/13 =1/13,\n\nThus,\n\ny = -135/4*(1/13) +5\n\nCompute that:\n\n-135/(52) +5 = (-135/52 +260/52) =125/52, which is exactly the y-coordinate. So yes, that works. So the third symmedian also passes through the point (40/13, 125/52). Therefore, the coordinates are confirmed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wanted a different method, maybe using circles?\n\nHmm, the symmedian point can also be constructed as the intersection of the tangents to the circumcircle of the triangle, but I might not be recalling that correctly. Alternatively, the problem mentions equations of circles, so maybe we can use some circle properties here.\n\nWait, another property is that the symmedian point is the center of the Kiepert hyperbola, but perhaps that's too advanced. Alternatively, the locus of symmedian point may relate to certain circles?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps constructing the symmedian point through geometric constructions involving circles... Hmm, not sure, but since I already have the coordinates through two methods, maybe I can stick with the result.\n\nAlternatively, another way to find the symmedian point is using coordinates by reflecting the centroid over the sides? Hmm, no, that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, using trigonometric coordinates.\n\nBut in any case, since I verified it by two different methods, the coordinates are (40/13,125/52). So unless I made calculation errors in both methods, which is possible but less likely, that should be correct. Let me check the first method once again.\n\nFirst method: using the formula with a²,b²,c².\n\na²=74, b²=34,c²=100.\n\nSo,\n\nx = (a²*0 + b²*10 +c²*3)/ (74+34+100)\n\n= (34*10 +100*3)/208 = (340 + 300)/208= 640/208=40/13.\n\nYes,\n\ny = (a²*0 + b²*0 +c²*5)/208= 100*5/208=500/208=125/52. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I believe the coordinates are indeed (40/13, 125/52). To present this as fractions, 40/13 is approximately 3.0769, 125/52≈2.4038.\n\nAlternatively, to write as fractions:\n\n40 divided by 13 is simplest.\n\n125/52 is also reduced.\n\nTherefore, boxed answer is \\boxed{\\left( \\dfrac{40}{13}, \\dfrac{125}{52} \\right)}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coordinates of the symmedian point are \\boxed{\\left( \\dfrac{40}{13}, \\dfrac{125}{52} \\right)}.\n[/think]\n\nTo determine the coordinates of the symmedian point of the triangle with vertices \\(A(0,0)\\), \\(B(10,0)\\), and \\(C(3,5)\\), we use the property that the symmedian point can be found using the formula involving the squares of the side lengths. The formula for the coordinates of the symmedian point \\(K\\) is:\n\n\\[\nK \\left( \\frac{a^2 x_A + b^2 x_B + c^2 x_C}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}, \\frac{a^2 y_A + b^2 y_B + c^2 y_C}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} \\right)\n\\]\n\nFirst, we compute the lengths of the sides opposite each vertex:\n- Side \\(a = BC\\): Distance between \\(B(10,0)\\) and \\(C(3,5)\\):\n  \\[\n  a = \\sqrt{(10-3)^2 + (0-5)^2} = \\sqrt{49 + 25} = \\sqrt{74}\n  \\]\n- Side \\(b = AC\\): Distance between \\(A(0,0)\\) and \\(C(3,5)\\):\n  \\[\n  b = \\sqrt{(3)^2 + (5)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 25} = \\sqrt{34}\n  \\]\n- Side \\(c = AB\\): Distance between \\(A(0,0)\\) and \\(B(10,0)\\):\n  \\[\n  c = \\sqrt{(10)^2} = 10\n  \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the squares of these side lengths:\n- \\(a^2 = 74\\)\n- \\(b^2 = 34\\)\n- \\(c^2 = 100\\)\n\nUsing the coordinates of the vertices \\(A(0,0)\\), \\(B(10,0)\\), and \\(C(3,5)\\), we compute the coordinates of the symmedian point:\n\nFor the \\(x\\)-coordinate:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{a^2 x_A + b^2 x_B + c^2 x_C}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} = \\frac{74 \\cdot 0 + 34 \\cdot 10 + 100 \\cdot 3}{74 + 34 + 100} = \\frac{0 + 340 + 300}{208} = \\frac{640}{208} = \\frac{40}{13}\n\\]\n\nFor the \\(y\\)-coordinate:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{a^2 y_A + b^2 y_B + c^2 y_C}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} = \\frac{74 \\cdot 0 + 34 \\cdot 0 + 100 \\cdot 5}{74 + 34 + 100} = \\frac{0 + 0 + 500}{208} = \\frac{500}{208} = \\frac{125}{52}\n\\]\n\nTo verify, we found the equations of the symmedian lines from vertices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) and their intersection confirmed the coordinates. The symmedian from \\(C\\) also passes through this point, ensuring correctness.\n\nThus, the coordinates of the symmedian point are:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\left( \\dfrac{40}{13}, \\dfrac{125}{52} \\right)}\n\\]"
